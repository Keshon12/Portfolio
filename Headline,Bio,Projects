Hi, Iâ€™m Keshon. I am a full stack developer and video game enthusiast
I am a web developer and recent graduate from the Front End Web Development Career Path bootcamp at Thinkful. I love coding and the challenges that come with it. I enjoy problem solving and also enjoy creating things that work from scratch. I find it really satisfying after finishing a program I created from scratch or solving a complicated problem. 
When I am not coding, I love to spend my time gaming or working out. This allows me to relax and be refreshed for future coding challenges.
